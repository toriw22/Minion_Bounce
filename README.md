# Minion_Bounce

The app produces a random goal number. In order to reach that number, the player must click on the minions to add to their score. 

How to play:

   * Each minion is a clickable button with a randomly assigned value.

   * The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.

   * When the player clicks on a minion, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. 

   * The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

   * The player loses if their score goes above the random number.

   * The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.

   * When the game begins again, the player will see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. Of course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.

   * The app also shows the number of games the player wins and loses. To that end, do not refresh the page as a means to restart the game.
